Data science is an inter-disciplinary field that uses scientific methods, processes, algorithms
and systems to extract knowledge and insights from many structural and unstructured
data.[1][2] Data science is related to data mining, machine learning and big data. Data
science is a "concept to unify statistics, data analysis, machine learning, domain knowledge
and their related methods" in order to "understand and analyze actual phenomena" with
data.[3] It uses techniques and theories drawn from many fields within the context of
mathematics, statistics, computer science, domain knowledge and information science. Turing
award winner Jim Gray imagined data science as a "fourth paradigm" of science (empirical,
theoretical, computational and now data-driven) and asserted that "everything about science
is changing because of the impact of information technology" and the data deluge. Data
science is an interdisciplinary field focused on extracting knowledge from data sets, which are
typically large (see big data).[6] The field encompasses analysis, preparing data for analysis,
and presenting findings to inform high-level decisions in an organization. As such, it
incorporates skills from computer science, mathematics, statistics, information visualization,
graphic design, and business.[7][8] Statistician Nathan Yau, drawing on Ben Fry, also links
data science to human-computer interaction: users should be able to intuitively control and
explore data.[9][10] In 2015, the American Statistical Association identified database
management, statistics and machine learning, and distributed and parallel systems as the
three emerging foundational professional communities.[11]
